## Running the code

The folder Tissue Specific FBA contains a set of demo prerequisite .mat variables and a RUN.m script that can be run in MATLAB. 
The gene expression dataset integrated in this tutorial is the TCGA breast cancer dataset:
https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga
To perform the analysis, simply open RUN.m in MATLAB and run the script.
All variables and datasets can be substituted and the script can be adapted according to the users' requirements.
