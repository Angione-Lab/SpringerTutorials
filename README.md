## Running the code

Each of the four subfolders within the repository contains scripts, variables and datasets associated with one of four tutorials described in the publication "A Practical Guide to Integrating Multimodal Machine Learning and Metabolic Modeling".  

The figure `pipeline.pdf` summarizes the workflow for the integration of metabolic modeling with multimodal machine learning and survival analysis outlined in the four tutorials contained in each of the subfolders.

In summary, gene expression data is used as input for a human genome-scale model of breast cancer to generate context-specific metabolic fluxes. These fluxes are in turn used as input for survival (time-to-event) prediction or machine learning analysis using data that has been informed by alterations in metabolic pathways. Further details relating to each analysis are provided in the subfolders.

Note that the tutorial for Tissue Specific FBA must be run before the Survival Analysis, Classification Task with Early Data Integration or Regression Task with Late Data Integration since `fluxes.csv` is a prerequisite for applying survival or machine learning analysis. The latter three tutorials can be run in any order.
